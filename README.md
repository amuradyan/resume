### Senior Scala engineer - [DataArt Armenia](https://www.dataart.com)

04.04.2022 - 18.07.2024

**Tech used:** Scala 2.13, Akka, Play, tAPIr, AWS SQS, IBM MQ, Cats

Overall I've spent about two years in two teams on a project in travel industry, automating cruise reservation flows across multiple agents and elements.

My main contribution to the project was a module to search plane tickets. I've managed to maintain a well-tested and coherent codebase and an structured repository, and learned that frequent demos calm the worried mind and help avoiding *dirty* estimates. Our team was able to experiment and agree on what's good or bad, so we were able to affect our modules of the project both technically /code style and structure, tooling, practices/ and process-wise /CI\\CD, branching strategy, code review, .../.

Soon after, I took up the role of the **team lead** of a team of five /team 1/ and led it for three months. The team was in charge of several modules central to the operation, both semantically and topologically. I tried to get *better code reviews* via pair programming and a *clearer* information flow via more inclusive requirement gathering in attempt to address system correctness issues. These, along with a few others ideas, did not work out due to different socioeconomic reasons. Nevertheless, the team was able to maintain a deliverable flow suiting the needs at the moment.

For the last two months, I've been primarily engaged in maintenance tasks, frequently collaborating with a colleague.
