Led a team of 5 for a few months. To mitigate occasional misunderstanding and later system failures, we decided to resort to pair programming and early-on inclusive requirement gathering. Unfortunately, we were not able to sustain such practices at an acceptable pace for long enough, but the team was able to maintain a deliverable flow suiting the needs at the moment.

Led training courses and mentored junior colleagues by developing toy projects for hands-on learning.

Pleasantly surprised to learn that a team of 2, given enough time and rigid practices, can get to a board with just 1-2 pointers. Note that the points are not the time it takes to do the task, but rather how well we understand what we shall do - a *smoothness* coefficient of a sort.
